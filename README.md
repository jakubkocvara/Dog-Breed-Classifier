![](readme_pic.png)

## Project Overview
This is the capstone project of the Udacity data science nanodegree. 
You can read the original README and the instructions on how to run this project here: [https://github.com/udacity/dog-project](https://github.com/udacity/dog-project).

We are training Convolutional Neural Networks to identify dog-breeds based on an image. First one from scratch and in the second part we are using transfer learning using pre-trained models.

## Building our own CNN
